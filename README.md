### API Rate Limits
#### Overview
API rate limits are restrictions on the number of requests that can be made to an API within a certain time frame. These limits are typically put in place to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.

#### Example Use Cases
- Preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
- Managing API traffic during peak usage times
- Ensuring fair usage of the API among multiple users

#### Implementation
API rate limits can be implemented using various methods, including:
- Token bucket algorithm
- Leaky bucket algorithm
- Fixed time window algorithm

#### Best Practices
- Clearly document API rate limits in the API documentation
- Provide a way for users to check their current rate limit status
- Implement rate limiting at multiple levels (e.g., per user, per IP address)
