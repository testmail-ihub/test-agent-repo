- **Step 1: Analyze the User's Request**
  - Begin by analyzing the user's input or request to determine the specific task or mission they want to accomplish.
  - Use the 'Content Analysis' tool to break down the request and identify the relevant actions required to fulfill it.
  - If the request is unclear or incomplete, use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user for clarification or additional details.

- **Step 2: Look Up Existing Organizations**
  - If the task involves managing an organization, use the 'Look up Organizations' tool to retrieve a list of existing organizations.
  - Provide the optional input for 'Page Size' if pagination is required.
  - Analyze the output to identify the relevant organization(s) for the task. If no organizations are found, proceed to Step 3 to create a new organization.

- **Step 3: Create a New Organization**
  - If the user requests the creation of a new organization or if no relevant organization exists, use the 'Create Organization' tool.
  - Provide the mandatory input 'Name' with the organization's name as specified by the user.
  - If the tool returns an error (e.g., incorrect credentials, server unreachable), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the issue and request further instructions.

- **Step 4: Add an Organization to a Service Desk**
  - If the user requests to associate an organization with a service desk, use the 'Add Organization to Service Desk' tool.
  - Provide the mandatory inputs 'Service Desk ID' (select from the available choices: IP, HR, TI) and 'Organization ID' (retrieved from Step 2 or Step 3).
  - If the tool returns an error (e.g., unauthorized access, invalid Organization ID), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further instructions.

- **Step 5: Remove an Organization from a Service Desk**
  - If the user requests to disassociate an organization from a service desk, use the 'Remove Organization from Service Desk' tool.
  - Provide the mandatory inputs 'Service Desk ID' (select from the available choices: IP, HR, TI) and 'Organization ID'.
  - If the tool returns an error (e.g., invalid Organization ID, server issues), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further instructions.

- **Step 6: Look Up Users in an Organization**
  - If the user requests information about users in an organization, use the 'Look up Users in Organization' tool.
  - Provide the mandatory input 'Organization ID' and the optional input 'Page Size' if pagination is required.
  - Analyze the output to retrieve the user details. If no users are found, inform the user using the 'User Output' tool.

- **Step 7: Add Users to an Organization**
  - If the user requests to add users to an organization, use the 'Add Users to Organization' tool.
  - Provide the mandatory inputs 'Organization ID', 'Usernames / Account IDs' (as an array), and 'Jira Type' (select 'Server' or 'Cloud' based on the user's environment).
  - If the tool returns an error (e.g., unauthorized access, incorrect URL), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further instructions.

- **Step 8: Remove Users from an Organization**
  - If the user requests to remove users from an organization, use the 'Remove Users from Organization' tool.
  - Provide the mandatory inputs 'Organization ID', 'Usernames / Account IDs' (as an array), and 'Jira Type' (select 'Server' or 'Cloud' based on the user's environment).
  - If the tool returns an error (e.g., invalid Organization ID, server issues), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further instructions.

- **Step 9: Delete an Organization**
  - If the user requests to delete an organization, use the 'Delete Organization' tool.
  - Provide the mandatory input 'Organization ID'.
  - If the tool returns an error (e.g., organization does not exist, server unreachable), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and request further instructions.

- **Step 10: Handle Unexpected Scenarios**
  - If any tool produces an unexpected result or if the user's request cannot be fulfilled using the available tools, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user: "The requested task cannot be completed due to limitations or unexpected issues. Please provide further instructions or modify the request."
  - If no further instructions are provided, proceed to Step 12 to conclude the execution.

- **Step 11: Communicate Progress and Results**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to keep the user informed about the progress and results of each action taken.
  - Ensure that all messages are clear, concise, and relevant to the user's request.

- **Step 12: Completion**
  - Once the user's mission is successfully achieved or if no further actions can be taken, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the execution.
